Opening the game:
After opening, you will need to navigate to the first level. Open Content Drawer -> Content -> Maps -> Levels -> L1. Once the level is opened press the play button at the top of the unreal engine window.

Playing the game:
A window will come up for you to select the difficulty for your game. You will be able to move the ball with the "wasd" keys. You will also be able to press spacebar to jump. You will need to avoid hitting the enemies that are on the map. You will lose health if you hit the enemies. You will lose lives if you fall off of the map, or if your health bar goes to zero. Each map will have a key that you will need to collect in order to advance to the next level. Once the key is collected, then you will be able to take a portal to the next level. Your score will be determined from your lives and the time that it takes you to complete the level. The further that you get on the levels, the harder it will be to complete.

Key mappings:
Movement: WASD
Jump: Space Bar

Scoring:
Scoring work is calculated for each independent level and is displayed upon the completion of each level.

Level Score = (Difficulty){[(500)(Level Time)-1] + [(1000)(Health)] + [(200)(Lives Left)]}

Time: 0-Infinite Seconds
Health: 0-1
Lives: 0-5
Difficulty: 1-3
